### This is a Navier-Stokes based 2D fluid simulation implemented in C++ using [olcPixelGameEngine](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine).

## Controls
- Hold <kbd>LMB</kbd> to add fluid and velocity
- Velocity is added according to mouse movement
- Press <kbd>R</kbd> to reset the simulation.
